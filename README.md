# AutoAnim Plugin for Godot 3.5
A plugin for Godot Engine v3.5 that aims to make the character creations and animation process for 2D projects simpler and more efficient.  This plugin takes a given spritesheet and creates animations from it which are then set up into a BlendSpace2D node in an AnimationTree.
